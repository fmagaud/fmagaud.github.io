We all know the movement Black Lives Matter. In Europe, it became widely known after the death of George Floy in Minnesota, choked under the knee of the police officer in charge of his arrest. Following this event, major protests took place in various cities across the Old Continent to denounce racial inequalities and police brutality and discrimination against non-white citizens. 

But the movement Black Lives Matter was created long before. The \#BLACKLIVESMATTER first appeared on social media in the United States in July 2013. What was the starting point of this movement ? The acquittal of the neighborhood watch coordinator George Zimmerman, responsible for the shooting of the African American Trayvin Martin. This is the major event that launched the creation of the now worldwide known movement "Black Lives Matter" that aims to advocate against violence inflicted on Black communities.
