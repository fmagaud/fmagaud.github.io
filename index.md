We all know the movement Black Lives Matter. In Europe, it became widely known after the death of George Floy in Minnesota, choked under the knee of the police officer in charge of his arrest. Following this event, major protests took place in various cities across the Old Continent to denounce racial inequalities and police brutality and discrimination against non-white citizens. 

But the movement Black Lives Matter was created long before. The \#BLACKLIVESMATTER first appeared on social media in the United States in July 2013. What was the starting point of this movement ? The acquittal of the neighborhood watch coordinator George Zimmerman, responsible for the shooting of the African American Trayvin Martin. This is the major event that launched the creation of the now worldwide known movement "Black Lives Matter" that aims to advocate against violence inflicted on Black communities. 

Seven years after the creation of this movement it is interesting to analyze the situation and to ask the question: did the Black Lives Matter movement manage to reduce the ratial disparities in the United States ?

To answer this question, we will study the number of arrests of Adrican Americans in L.A. and assess the impact of the creation of this movement.

# How African American arrestations evolved after the creation of the movement ?

 - #### first the difference of black people arrests in number before and after July 2013.
 - #### second the change in trends after this point through a segmented regression analysis.

Now that we have seen the impact of July 2013 on the evolution of the arrests of the African American, let's have a look at its influence on other races !

# How did the creation of this movement impacted the other races ?


Let's begin our analysis by checking the impact of the Black Lives Matter movement on the arrests of White people in L.A.. We all agree that the movement aims at reducing the racial disparities and at eradicating white supremacy. The Black Lives Matter movement should therefore not impact so much the arrestation trend of white people right ?

ADD GRAPH COMPARISON OF MEANS BEFORE AND AFTER

With a first look on the data, we can see that there is quite a difference between the mean of arrestations before and after July 2013. That's not what we were expecting... Before jumping to any conclusion, we should have a look at the representation of the segmented regression analysis.

ADD GRAPH OF THE SRA WITH THE COMPARISON OF WHITE AND BLACK ARREST

Well that's unfortunate, we find a similar trend for the arrests of White people and for the arrests of African Americans... How could we explain that ? 

After some digging in the political history of L.A., we found that a the 42nd mayor of L.A. has been elected in 2013. Eric Garcetti began his term as L.A. mayer on the 1st of July 2013. The Agenda of the new mayor is focused on converting his city into a safe, livable, and prosperous municipality. This could explain the observed decrease in the overall trend of arrests of white people.
