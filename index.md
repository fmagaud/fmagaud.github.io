We all know the movement Black Lives Matter. In Europe, it became widely known after the death of George Floy in Minnesota, choked under the knee of the police officer in charge of his arrest. Following this event, major protests took place in various cities across the Old Continent to denounce racial inequalities and police brutality and discrimination against non-white citizens. 

But the movement Black Lives Matter was created long before. The \#BLACKLIVESMATTER first appeared on social media in the United States in July 2013. What was the starting point of this movement ? The acquittal of the neighborhood watch coordinator George Zimmerman, responsible for the shooting of the African American Trayvin Martin. This is the major event that launched the creation of the now worldwide known movement "Black Lives Matter" that aims to advocate against violence inflicted on Black communities. 

Seven years after the creation of this movement it is interesting to analyze the situation and to ask the question: did the Black Lives Matter movement manage to reduce the ratial disparities in the United States ?

To answer this question, we will study the number of arrests of African Americans in L.A. and assess the impact of the creation of this movement on the evolution of the arrests.

Let's begin with a first and broad analysis of the data. What is the row number of arrestations for each race in L.A. per year ?

<span style="color:red"> Figure, to update --> average per year

This figure shows us the annual average number of arrests from 2010 to 2019, including the period before and after the movement. And indeed, we can already see that there seems to be racial inequalities. But, we certainly need to take into account the population in each race. If there were 5 times more African American in L.A. it would be logic that they’d be 5 times more arrested ! So, for the 3 main races: Black, Hispanic and White, we scaled these numbers to obtain the annual number of arrests per person, i.e. the ratio of people within a population getting arrested.

Oh man this is an impressive result, and not in the good way. Apparently, African Americans are arrested almost 5 times more than Whites. Does this reflects only racial discrimination ? Let’s keep in mind that it could also reflect the uneven repartition of the races within the different social classes. In our opinion it is probably a mix of both.

# How African American arrestations evolved after the creation of the movement ?

 - #### first the difference of black people arrests in number before and after July 2013.

 - #### second the change in trends after this point through a segmented regression analysis.
 

Now that we have seen the clear impact of July 2013 on the evolution of the arrests of the African American, let's have a look at its influence on the arrests of White people !

# How did the creation of this movement impacted White arrests ?

Let's begin our analysis by checking the impact of the Black Lives Matter movement on the arrests of White people in L.A.. We all agree that the movement aims at reducing the racial disparities and at eradicating white supremacy. The Black Lives Matter movement should therefore not impact so much the arrestation trend of white people right ?

With a first look on the data, we can see that there is quite a difference between the mean of arrestations before and after July 2013. We can observe a decrease of approximately 22.86\% in the total arrests of African Americans between the two periods studied (the first period being between beginning of 2010 until July 2013 and the second perdio being between July 2013 and end of 2016). That's not what we were expecting... Before jumping to any conclusion, we should have a look at the representation of the segmented regression analysis.

Well that's unfortunate, we find a similar trend for the arrests of White people and for the arrests of African Americans... How could we explain that ? 

<span style="color:red">should we add here the analysis of the regression talbe ? Just mention it has been done and July 2013 is a significant intervention text</span>

After some digging in the political history of L.A., we found that a the 42nd mayor of L.A. has been elected in 2013. Eric Garcetti began his term as L.A. mayer on the 1st of July 2013. The Agenda of the new mayor is focused on converting his city into a safe, livable, and prosperous municipality. This could explain the observed decrease in the overall trend of arrests of white people.

# Was the disparities between White and African Americans arrestations impacted by the creation of the movement ?

At this stage of the study, we have only studied the evolution of the arrests for different races. Has it has been shown previously, the events that occured in June 2013 (either the creation of the Black Lives Matter movement, either the nomination of the new mayor at L.A.) lead to a significant decrease in the number of arrests of the African Americans and the White people. <span style="color:red"> These events did not significantly impact the evolution of the arrests of Hispanic people (that was already in a decreasing mode). </span>

Remember our initial question: did the Black Lives Matter movement manage to reduce the ratial disparities in the United States ? we only answered to the question :did the creation of the Black Lives Matter movement influence the arrestations of African Americans ? 

Let's go back to this first question and see whether the creation of the Black Lives Matter movement helped reduce the discrimination of African Americans (which is basicelly the main aim of this movement).

To address this question we can study the evolution of the difference in the number of arrests of African Amercians and White people. When the number of arrests of African Americans (respectively of White people) is reported to the size of the African American population (respectively to the size of the White population) in L.A., the difference between the number of arrests between each race can be seen as a measure of the equality between these two races: the closest to 0 (meaning that the number of arrests for each race is most similar), the less inquality there is between the races. 

Hoping this is clear enough, let's study the evolution of this difference !
